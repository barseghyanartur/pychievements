Pychievements: The Python Achievments Framework!
================================================

|docs|

**Pychievements** is a framework for creating and tracking achievements within a Python application.
It includes functions specifically for creating commandline applications, though it is flexible 
enough to be used for any application such as web applications.

See the examples_ to get a good feel for what Pychievements offers. Docuementation can be found RTD:
http://pychievements.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

.. _examples: https://github.com/PacketPerception/pychievements/tree/master/examples


Features:
---------
 - Create Achievements with any number of "goals" (based on levels) that can be reached
 - Flexible design makes it easy to customize the way levels are tracked
 - Easy to add new achievements later
 - Pluggable backend for storing tracked information in different formats to different locations
 - Achievements can be filtered by category or keywords
 - Easily specify "Icons" for individual goals within an achievement for dual states (achieved and
   unachieved)


Example
-------

A simple achievement. ::

    class MyAchievement(Achievement):
        name = "My Achievement"
        category = "achievements"
        keywords = ("my", "achievement")
        goals = (
            {"level": 10, "name": "Level 1", "icon": icons.star, "description": "Level One" },
            {"level": 20, "name": "Level 2", "icon": icons.star, "description": "Level Two" },
            {"level": 30, "name": "Level 3", "icon": icons.star, "description": "Level Three" },
        )


Increment a level for a user. ::

    tracker.increment(user_id, MyAchievment)


Re-evaluating a level for a user based on arguments (requires the evaluate function to be defined 
or the Achievement). ::

    tracker.evluate(user_id, MyAchievement, some, extra, args)


Retrieve achievements. ::

    tracker.achievements()                # retrieves all registered achievements in the tracker
    tracker.achieved(uid, achievement)    # all achieved goals by uid for achievement
    tracker.unachieved(uid, achievement)  # all unachieved goals by uid for achievement
    tracker.current(uid, achievement)     # goal currently being worked torwards by uid


Installation
------------

To install pychievements, simply: ::
